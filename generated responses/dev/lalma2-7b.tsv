This type of transport is driven by the difference in concentration of the substance being transported across the membrane, and requires energy to overcome the concentration gradient. Examples of active transport include the transport of glucose into a cell through the cell membrane and the transport of oxygen from the blood into the tissue. Passive transport, on the other hand, refers to the movement of molecules or ions across a cell memb

1047162	"Residual networks (ResNets) are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in 2015 by Kaiming He et al. in the paper ""Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"". The key innovation of ResNets is the use of residual connections, which allow the network to learn much deeper representations than previously possible. Traditional neural networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients used to update the network's weights become smaller as they propagate through the network, making it difficult to train deep networks. Residual connections create shortcuts"
